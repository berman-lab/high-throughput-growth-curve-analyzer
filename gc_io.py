    Desrciption
    -----------
    Read the content of a xlsx file from a tecan stakcer format
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path : str
        The path to the folder where all the data for analysis is stored
    data_rows : list of strings
        The rows of the xlsx file that are to be read

    pandas.DataFrame
        The dataframe containing the data from the xlsx file. Data frame containing the columns:
        - ``Filename`` (:py:class:`str`): the letter corresponding to the well row.
        - ``Plate`` (:py:class:`str`): the number corresponding to the well column.
        - ``Well`` (:py:class:`str`): the well name, usually a letter for the row and a number of the column.
        - ``Time`` (:py:class:`float`, in hours)
        - ``OD600`` (:py:class:`float`, in AU)
